# practice-zakariah-J

Hi! I am Zak. My friends call me Smac. I love in Merced, California, about 35 minutes north of where the Palm meets the Pine. I am excited to learn more concerning coding and increase my abilities in that area. I have many interests and I am afraid of dying without engaging in them all, satiating my yearn for completion. Some of my interests are languages (Italian, German, Spanish), computers (CS, video game development), Music (Bass guitar, lead guitar), classical writing, dancing, and many more.
